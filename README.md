i saw microSIP for desktop to connecting sip acocunts for call center agents they config microsip with their own SIP providers like telnyx or any when agent can suse SIP that develop  in  astertisk type server, this is for desktop, 
for phone we have Softphone by acrobits, PortSIP for Android / IOS 

but i didnt found any easy to use Web SIP Dailer so anyone can signup then add multiple profiles of sip, when calling user can top header showing which sip you are using for this call, tap to chnage option to select another sip, also on dailer show status by caller of SIp like same as Softphone Acrobits

i want you completely build this Web Dailer and  we will host it into firebase hosting, database we will firebase firestore, auth, rtdb, 
my suggestions: i want in vite js / ts shadcn + tailwindcss for modern look
but you can give more better languages suggestions for smoothness and fast respone,


now start your magic and give codes starting setting vite on local i want complete fullly funcational code, because you are ULTRA verison of Gemini, show how you satisfy, dont experiments or beta testing on me please, 

Start now

before coding you have give full detailed information how you work, services we needed, classes, languegges, flow daigram, then i like it then give you go a head to start finish it in a day,
for ULTRA Gemini this is just a small project, 
proove itÂ
